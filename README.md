# Reason Meetup Two

In order to be ready for the meetup we need to do a little setup.

We need to have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Reason-cli
- Editor with Reason extension
- Git

We'll go through each section and hopefully everyone will be ready to go on the day.

If you encounter any difficulty, just send a [message on Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/ReasonML-Dublin/events/254955135/) and we'll do our best to help you out.

## Node.js

If you are Linux or OSX this should come prepackaged with your OS. If you are on Windows, you may need to install it.

You can the see downloads on this page: [Node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Reason-cli

Once you have Node.js installed, NPM will come with it. You can simply run:

```
npm install -g bs-platform
```

to install the Reason-cli tools.

## Editor

We would suggest using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This is because if you have any issues we will be able to help you troubleshoot. VSCode also has very good support for Reason. You are however free to use any editor you like.

Once you have VSCode you should install the [reason-vscode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jaredly.reason-vscode). This plugin will give you all sorts of useful help when writing Reason.

If you open the settings by doing the following:

- On Windows/Linux - File > Preferences > Settings
- On macOS - Code > Preferences > Settings

Then search for the following:

```
Reason_language_server: Per_value_codelens
```

and click the checkbox. This will give us really handy inline inference of our types so we can know exactly whats going on.

## Git

On OSX and Linux this should come preinstalled. You can download Git for windows [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

## All Done

If you these things setup for the meetup we should be all good to go on working through Reason examples.

If you have any issues, don't hesitate to [message us on Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/ReasonML-Dublin/events/254955135/) and we look forward to seeing you!
